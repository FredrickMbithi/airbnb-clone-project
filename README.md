# AirBnB Clone Project (StayEase)

A full-stack clone of the AirBnB accommodation booking platform. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings.

## Project Goals
- Implement responsive UI/UX designs
- Structure a complex web application with clear separation of concerns
- Practice team collaboration with defined roles
- Use component-based frontend architecture
- Follow best practices for modern web development

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or similar framework)
- Version Control: Git and GitHub
- Design Tools: Figma for UI/UX design

---

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
- Create intuitive booking flow
- Maintain visual consistency
- Ensure fast loading times
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness

### Key Features
- Property search and filtering
- Detailed property viewing
- Secure checkout process
- User authentication

### Primary Pages

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Property Listing View | Grid display of available properties with filters |
| Listing Detailed View | Complete property details with images and booking form |
| Simple Checkout View | Streamlined payment and booking confirmation |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design
A well-designed booking system reduces friction in the user journey, increases conversion rates, and improves customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive design are critical for success.

### Figma Design Specifications

#### Color Styles
- Primary: #FF5A5F
- Secondary: #008489
- Background: #FFFFFF
- Text: #222222
- Secondary Text: #717171

#### Typography
- Primary Font: Circular, Medium (500), 16px
- Headings: Circular, Bold (700), 24px–32px
- Secondary Text: Circular, Book (400), 14px

#### Why Identify Design Properties?
Identifying color styles and typography from the mockup ensures consistency across the application, speeds up development by defining a shared design language, and improves accessibility by standardizing contrast and text sizes. It also enables the creation of a reusable design system and component library aligned with the Figma specs.

## Submission & Review
Your project will be evaluated primarily through manual reviews. To ensure full score:
- Complete your project on time
- Submit all required files
- Generate your review link
- Have peers review your work

An auto-check will verify presence of core files needed for manual review.

If the deadline passes, you won’t be able to generate a review link—submit on time.

Happy coding! ✨
